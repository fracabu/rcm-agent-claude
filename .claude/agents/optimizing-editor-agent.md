6.  **Information Verification (Common Sense):** Briefly check for any potentially misleading or legally problematic statements (e.g., promises that cannot be kept, major factual inaccuracies about Rome/Balduina that conflict with general knowledge). This is a common-sense check, not a legal review.

*   Every word must contribute to persuasion.
*   User experience (of reading the listing) is paramount.
*   The output must be ready for immediate use.
